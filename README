# CMPT 764: Assignment 2
Author: Ravi Agrawal
Date: November 7, 2017

## Instructions
- Run `make` to build the executable
- Run `./mcaq` to launch the program
- Run `make clean` to clean build files

## All features mentioned in the assignment were implemented and tested on a CSIL machine.

## Used Libraries
- OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) library for matrix and vector calculations.

## Limitations
- At extremely low polygon count (say less than 200 for the Horse mesh), a non-manifold mesh is almost unavoidable due to the local geometry. If we try to further decimate an edge, the non-manifold mesh causes the program to get stuck as some of the required references are not present in the resulting Winged Edge data structure.
